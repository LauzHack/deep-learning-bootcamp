# Deep Learning Bootcamp

Since 2016, LauzHack has organized hackathons at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. We also organize tech talks during the school year. 

This is a repository for our new event: a Deep Learning Summer Bootcamp.

# Projects 

Projects on different topics to get some practical experience:

- [__ASR__](./project_asr) Automatic Speech Recognition (Speech To Text)
- [__GAN__](./project_gan) Generative Adversarial Network (Image Generation and Neural Vocoder)
- [__AS__](./project_as) Anti-Spoofing
- TBD

To do all the heavy computations, use free Google Colab (8h/day) or Kaggle GPUs (30h/week).
