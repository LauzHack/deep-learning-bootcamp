# Project: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

We recommend using our [project template](https://github.com/Blinorot/pytorch_project_template).


### Task

Implement and train a neural-network speech recognition system with CTC loss. You are free to choose any model you like. We recommend you to have a look at these papers:

* [DeepSpeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567)
* [DeepSpeech 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595)
* [Conformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100)
* Or you can try a simple LSTM\GRU with LayerNorm between layers

**Try to avoid using implementations available on the internet**.

--------------

### General requirements

Requirements:

* The code should be stored in a public github (or gitlab) repository
* All the necessary packages should be mentioned in `./requirements.txt` or be installed in dockerfile
* All necessary resources (such as model checkpoints, LMs, and logs) should be downloadable with a script. Mention the script (or lines of code) in the `README.md`
* You should implement all functions in `test.py` (for evaluation) so that one can reproduce your results
* Basically, your `test.py` and `train.py` scripts should run without issues after running all commands in your installation guide.
* Log everything that is useful: losses, data, learning rate, gradient norm, etc.
* Provide the logs for the training of your final model from the start of the training. We heavily recommend you to use W&B Reports feature.
* Attach a brief report. That includes:
    * How to reproduce your model? (_example: train 50 epochs with config `train_1.yaml` and 50 epochs with `train_2.yaml`_)
    * Attach training logs to show how fast did you network train
    * How did you train your final model?
    * What have you tried?
    * What worked and what didn't work?
    * What were the major challenges?

  Also attach a summary of all bonus tasks you've implemented.

### Quality score

| Score  | Dataset | CER | WER| Description|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------      |
| 1.0 | -- | -- | -- | At least you tried |
| 2.0 | LibriSpeech: test-clean | 50 | -- | Well, it's something |
| 3.0 | LibriSpeech: test-clean | 30 | -- | You can guess the target phrase if you try |
| 4.0 | LibriSpeech: test-clean | 20 | -- | It gets some words right |
| 5.0 | LibriSpeech: test-clean | -- | 40 | More than half of the words are looking fine |
| 6.0 | LibriSpeech: test-clean | -- | 30 | It's quite readable |
| 7.0 | LibriSpeech: test-clean | -- | 20 | Occasional mistakes  |
| 8.0 | LibriSpeech: **test-other** | -- | 30 | Your network can handle somewhat noisy audio. |
| 8.5 | LibriSpeech: **test-other** | -- | 25 | Your network can handle somewhat noisy audio but it is still just close enough. |
| 9.0 | LibriSpeech: **test-other** | -- | 20 | Somewhat suitable for practical applications. |
| 10.0 | LibriSpeech: **test-other** | -- | 10 | Technically better than a human. Well done! |

Dataset can be found [here](https://www.openslr.org/12) and on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/a24998667/librispeech).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use only train partitions of LibriSpeech or [Mozilla Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en) and data augmentation techniques to train your model.

To calculate the metrics, you can use `torchmetrics` implementation of [CER](https://lightning.ai/docs/torchmetrics/stable/text/char_error_rate.html) and [WER](https://lightning.ai/docs/torchmetrics/stable/text/word_error_rate.html).

To save some coding time, you can use [HuggingFace dataset library](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets). Look how easy it is:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("librispeech_asr", split='train-clean-360')
```

--------------

### Optional tasks

* Use an external language model for evaluation. The choice of an LM-fusion method is up to you. You may find [this library](https://github.com/kensho-technologies/pyctcdecode) helpful.
  ***Note: implementing this part will yield a very significant quality boost (which will improve your score by a lot). We heavily recommend you to implement this part.***
* BPE instead of characters. You can use SentencePiece, HuggingFace, or YouTokenToMe.
